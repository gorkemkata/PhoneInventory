# PhoneInventory
A web application written in Java

My internship project. A phone inventory application for IcTerra

You can reserve/drop phones, edit them, add new phones or delete existing ones.
There is also an Admin control panel that has extra features.

You can import the project on eclipse to run it. You need a mysql server to connect which is
done in DatabaseConnector class. And you need a webserver to run on.
